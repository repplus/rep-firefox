# Security Policy

rep+ is a Chrome DevTools extension that captures and inspects HTTP requests.  
Because it uses permissions like `activeTab`, `webRequest`, and optional `<all_urls>`, security is important.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security issue, you can report it in two ways:

1. **Open a security issue** on GitHub
2. **Email:** repbscript@gmail.com
